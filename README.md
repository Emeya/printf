=======
This printf project is a collaboration between Iyaye and Maryprincess Who are Software Engineers studing at students of ALX school. This project involves a function named "_printf" which would imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. This function contains some of the basic features and functions found in the man 3 of "printf".

What you would learn from this project:

How to use git in a team setting
Applying variadic functions to big projects
The complexities of printf
Managing a lot of flies and finding a good workflow
